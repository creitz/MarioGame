Changes not made to code that were suggested by running code analysis:

	1)  FireballCollisionResponder, FireFlowerCollisionResponder, 
		GreenMushroomCollisionResponder, RedMushroomCollisionResponder, and 
		StarCollisionResponder were all classes for which it was suggested to remove the
		"side" paramter to the method call of RespondToCollision(Side, IObject).  This was 
		not done because having those parameters allows that method to be called from 
		CollisionDetector on objects of type IObject, as each of these objects implement this
		method from the interface.  In order to implement the IObject interface, they 
		must have a method with this signature.  


	2) There is a warning for cyclomatic complexity in the level creator class. I believe it's unavoidable
		since that portion of the code is bulk to deal with the parsing of the input file.
