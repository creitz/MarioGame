Changes not made to code that were suggested by running code analysis:

	1)  For FireFlowerCollisionResponder it suggested to remove the
		"side" paramter to the method call of RespondToCollision(Side, IObject) and the "intersectrect"
		parameter for PipeCollisionResponder for the same method.  This was 
		not done because having those parameters allows that method to be called from 
		CollisionDetector on objects of type IObject, as this object implement this
		method from the interface.  In order to implement the IObject interface, it 
		must have a method with this signature.
