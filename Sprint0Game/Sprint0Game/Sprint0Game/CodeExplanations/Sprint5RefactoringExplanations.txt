Changes not made to code that were suggested by running code analysis:

	1)  For FireFlowerCollisionResponder it suggested to remove the
		"side" paramter to the method call of RespondToCollision().  This was 
		not done because having those parameters allows that method to be called from 
		CollisionDetector on objects of type IObject, as this object implements this
		method from the interface.  In order to implement the IObject interface, it 
		must have a method with this signature.
