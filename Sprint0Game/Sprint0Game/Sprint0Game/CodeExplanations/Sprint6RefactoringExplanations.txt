Changes not made to code that were suggested by running code analysis:

	1)  For FireFlowerCollisionResponder it suggested to remove the
		"side" paramter to the method call of RespondToCollision().  This was 
		not done because having those parameters allows that method to be called from 
		CollisionDetector on objects of type IObject, as this object implements this
		method from the interface.  In order to implement the IObject interface, it 
		must have a method with this signature.  

	2)  The cyclomatic complexity warning for CheckAlphabeticKeys in Keybinder was not eliminated because it would not
	    make sense to split that up into multiple methods or break apart the logic...there are 26 letters in the alphabet,
		so getting the cyclomatic complexity below 25 as suggested would just not make sense.  

	3)  The use of a multidimensional array is integral to how the LevelEncoder encodes the level.
		Familiarity with jagged arrays is slightly less so it was a design choice to use it based
		level of experience and time available.
