Review:

	Cohesion & Coupling:
		-Very high cohesion, fairly low coupling.  Mostly independent of other classes except
		that draw() depends on spritebatch.begin() being called before draw(), otherwise spritebatch.draw() 
		will not work...should not change, though...good for the project as a whole.  Also dependent on 
		centralized SpriteHolder.  

	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		-Low cyclomatic complexity: no nesting of conditional logic (only 1 tier of if statements, though 
		two consecutive ones).  4 possible execution paths in Update(), 1 possible path in constructor and
		draw().

	Hypothetical Change:
		-If a different spritesheet was used, this would easily be changed since the number of columns/frames
		is retrieved from a single source (SpriteHolder), and dimensions are determined dynamically.
		
		-If the speed at which koopa walks was changed, an additional parameter (or similar method) would 
		be needed to alter the rate of frame change.  In addition, there is no logic for moving koopa's 
		location as he actually walks.
