Review:

	-No nesting of logic, so cyclomatic complexity is not too bad. 12 different execution paths in the
	constructor. 8 paths in Update(). 1 path in Draw().

	-Has functional cohesion. The parts of the class all contribute to the well-defined task of the class
	which is to set the data for the Mario sprite and to draw him performing a jumping animation.

	-Practically no coupling. Almost completely independant of other classes. Instead of reading data
	from other classes, data is passed in as parameters. 

Hypothetical Change:
	
	-A hypothetical change to the game could be to increase or decrease the height Mario could jump based
	on level conditions or some new item intoduced. Since jumpHeight is hard-coded into the class, this
	change would not be handled easily within the class.
