Review:

	Cohesion & Coupling:
		-Very high cohesion, fairly low coupling.  Mostly independent of other classes except
		that draw() depends on spritebatch.begin() being called before draw(), but that should not be changed.  Also dependent on 
		centralized SpriteHolder which also benifits the project as a whole.  The public variable position will be needed in collision
		detection however SpriteBatch should not be public since nothing else should need to know about it.  

	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		-Low cyclomatic complexity: no nesting of conditional logic (only 1 tier of if statements).  4 possible execution paths in Update(), 1 possible path in constructor and
		draw().

	Hypothetical Change:
		-If the coin were to be collected there would be no way to make this change happen.
		
		-If you wanted to make the coin move (like when a block is bumped) there would be additional logic needed
