Review:

Cohesion and Coupling:

	Medium coupling in the controller which is somewhat expected since the keyboard controller
	passes around a lot of different objects based on input. The coupling is lowered significantly
	through the use of commands. The cohesion is high as well since the class mainly serves to pass 
	around objects based on input and does this without changing the objects.

Cyclomatic Complexity:
	
	The code has relatively low cyclomatic complexity since it only contains the for loop to check
	all the keys. There are some if/else loops within the code which may be unneccesary but they 
	do not necessarily over complexify the code.

Hypothetical Change:

	It could be beneficial to rework the if/else statement which controls the update delay in order to 
	simplify the cyclomatic complexity of the code. 

	Also, the for loop could probably be replaced with a foreach to enumerate through the keys
