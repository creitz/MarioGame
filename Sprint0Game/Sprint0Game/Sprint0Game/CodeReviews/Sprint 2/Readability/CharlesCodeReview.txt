Comments:

	What is Readable:
			
			-Spacing in Drawing Method is good...related chunks of code grouped together.

	What is Not Readable:
			
			-Method differentiation.  With no spaces between methods, the code blurs together, and each method is thus
				less readable
			-Instance variable declaration.  Also needs spacing, at very least from the constructor
			-Spacing in the constructor is absent, makes reading the constructor code more difficult


	Suggestions:

		-Add Comments--There are none...Why only increment currentframe if count is 5 in Update()?
		-Use "this" quantifier for instance variables even though it is not required for compilation
		-Add blank lines between methods
