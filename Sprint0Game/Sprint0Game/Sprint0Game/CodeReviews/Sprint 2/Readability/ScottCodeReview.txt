The organization of the methods made them very short and to the point, which helped with readability.  
The names of the methods and parameters were also very descriptive which was helpful in understanding 
the goal of each method.  It may help with readability if all the public variables were listed in a row 
rather than mixing them in the private variables as well.  One last thing that not very readable to 
someone that didn’t understand the code was the variable names coinRows and coinColumns.  It may help 
to change those to coinSpriteRows and coinSpriteColumns so they are a bit more descriptive.
