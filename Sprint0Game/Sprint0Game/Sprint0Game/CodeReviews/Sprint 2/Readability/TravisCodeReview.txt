What is readable:
- All methods are nice and simple to read and understand with the longest (DrawBlock) being nicely sectioned by purpose of the code.

What is not readable:
-For the most part, the code is well organized and very readable with no glaring problems

Suggestions: 
-More comments wouldn't hurt
