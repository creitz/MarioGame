What is readable:
	
	- Good use of comments to describe code progression
	- Variables are well named to give insight into what the code is doing

What is not readable: 

	- The depth of the nested loops is 3, which could probably be reworked to decrease it.
	- Doesn't need a Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input as the class has a using statement for it.
	- Could make better use of comments in the constructor to block out what each command pertains to.
	- May be able to use a foreach to iterate through pressed keys, making the code a bit more readable.
