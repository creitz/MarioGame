Review:

	Cohesion & Coupling:
		-Very high cohesion, fairly low coupling.  Mostly independent of other classes: references only Koopa, Mario,
		and the Geometry.Side enum.

	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		-Low cyclomatic complexity: no nesting of conditional logic (only 1 tier of if statements).  
		Currently only 2 possible execution paths in RespondToCollision(), though there will be
		more when the others are uncommented for future sprints.  Only 1 possible execution path
		in the constructor and 2 in the RespondToCollisionWithMario();

	Hypothetical Change:
		-If the response to a collision with some other object needed to be implemented, this
		could easily be done because all that would be needed is an additional method to handle
		it.  The object that collided with Koopa is passed in as well as the location of the 
		collision relative to Koopa, so all the information needed is accessible.  
		
		-If a collision with Koopa somehow affected the game, there would be no way to alter the
		Level or the Game because the class has no access to either of these, as no reference
		to either is passed in to the constructor or any method.
