Review:

	Cohesion:
		-Very high cohesion, every method that exists in this class belongs there and anything
		 that can be shipped out to another class has done so.
	
	Coupling:
		-Relatively low coupling.  Mostly independent of other classes. References Level,
		 Geometry.side enum, and IObject. However IObject has dozens of subclasses so
		 CollisionDetector.cs is very dependent on the performance of those classes.

	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		-Cyclomatic complexity is not too bad. Contains 2 sets of nested "for" loops. Also has
		 an "if-else" statement nested in each branch of another "if-else" statement. This case
		 occurs in GetCollisionSides() which has 4 possible execution paths. 

	Hypothetical Change:
		-In the case of Mario jumping on the turtle shell... The shell should shoot off to the right
		 if Mario jumps on the top-left of it, and it should shoot off to the left if Mario jumps
		 on the top-right of it. As this class currently stands, this top-left/top-right collision
		 cannot be detected.
