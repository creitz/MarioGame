Review:

	Cohesion & Coupling:
		-Very high cohesion, very low coupling.  Independent of other classes except
		for needing to know about the object class which is needed.  Their are no public variables declaired 

	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		-Low cyclomatic complexity: no nesting of conditional logic (only 1 tier of if statements).  1 possible 
		execution path in constructor and in RespondToCollisionWithMario(), 2 possible paths in RespondToCollision.

	Hypothetical Change:
		-If coins were to be collected by enemies as well.  This would be an easy change to just add an if 
		statement and a method
		
		-If you wanted to make the coin only collected by mario.  Also an easy change by just adding a condition.  
		You would have to cast mario though in order to access if he is big or not.  This issue is not really due to this class though.
