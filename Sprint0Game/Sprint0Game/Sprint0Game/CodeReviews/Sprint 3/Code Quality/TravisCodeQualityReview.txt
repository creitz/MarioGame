Review:

	Cohesion:
		-High cohesion, everything inside LevelCreator makes sense to be there.
	
	Coupling:
		-Very low coupling. LevelCreator is only bound to a level object which makes sense because 
		 it's purpose is to fill in a level.

	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		-At first glance, the GenerateLevel method looks very complex with a large amount of nesting due to 
		 the try-catch statements; however, the actual cyclomatic complexity isn't as bad as it would appear. 
 		 The while loop within GenerateLevel will often call CreateObjects which uses a foreach loop to create
		 the objects within the level. This gives us a worst case cylomatic complexity of 2 loops, which
		 unfortunately would not be easy to improve (one loop for each line and another for each object in that line).
	
	Hypothetical Change:
		-One change I would make would be to put the case select logic into it's own method just to make the flow of
		 CreateObjects a little more apparent, rather than a large switch statement. Call it something like 
		 AddObject(s) and it becomes much clearer how the logic within CreateObjects actually flows.
