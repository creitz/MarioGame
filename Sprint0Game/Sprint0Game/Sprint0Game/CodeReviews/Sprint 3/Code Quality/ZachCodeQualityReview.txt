Review:

	Cohesion:
		-High cohesion. The controller properly acts as a pass through for commands.
	
	Coupling:
		-Higher coupling, which occurs because the keyboard needs to know about a lot since it acts as a hub to
		pass around different commands. Coupling is reduced by use of commands.

	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		-Cyclomatic complexity is pretty good. A nested if within a for loop is the worst part of it, but doesn't
		 add a huge amount of complexity.

	Hypothetical Change:
		-As in the previous review, I believe he could replace the for loop with a foreach to better adhere to 
		C# code standards, and adding a using statement for keys would remove the need for the long strings of
		. connectors for keys[].
