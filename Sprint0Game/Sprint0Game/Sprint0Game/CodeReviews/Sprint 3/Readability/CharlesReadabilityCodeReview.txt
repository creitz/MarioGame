What is readable:

	-Every method & whole class have good spacing.
	-RespondToCollision(Geometry.Side side, IObject obj) {}
		 is very obvious in the logic it follows, despite multiple if-else if's


What is not readable: 

	-RespondToCollisionWithMario method, the logic is less obvious
	-Might be better to use "this" qualifier on calling private collision methods
	-Killing Koopa statement: 
			
			this.Koopa.Sprite.Dead = true; 
		
		is a little deep with successive dot accessors...could be clearer
		if Koopa had a .Kill() method i.e.:

			this.Koopa.Kill();

		, but it is still pretty clear what is going on.
