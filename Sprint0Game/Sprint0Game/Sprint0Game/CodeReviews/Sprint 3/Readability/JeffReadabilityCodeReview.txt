What is readable:
	
	- Good spacing within and in between methods.
	- Naming of variables is good, making it more obvious what each value represents.

What is not readable: 

	- Methods are pretty long, and involve several nested loops. (I know that is more
		of a code quality thing, but it also makes it more difficult to follow along with
		the code).
	- Needs more comments, especially in DetectCollisions.. For example to explain why
		it is necessary to have two instances of nested "for" loops.
