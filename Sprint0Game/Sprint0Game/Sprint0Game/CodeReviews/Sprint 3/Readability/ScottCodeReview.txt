It took 10 minutes to complete this review

The seperation and spacing of the methods was very good.  The only private variable declaired was placed well within the code.
The if conditions were very clear and method naming was very cohesive to the goal of each method.  One thing that could have better
naming in order to make it more clear is Coin.Sprite.dead.  I would suggest renaming it to maybe Collected.  It should also be 
capitalized since it is the name of a method.
