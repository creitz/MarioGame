What is readable:
	
	- Spacing between chunks of code makes it easier to read and understand related code
	- The method CreateObjects has a very easy to follow writing, with the case select cases being concise but easy to understand.
	- Good commenting throughout the file

What is not readable: 

	- GenerateLevel is rather complex and has several nested blocks of code that can be difficult to follow. 
		Some meaningful comments at the beginning of the block might help in understanding what's going on.
	- If possible, trim out some of the nested nature of GenerateLevel
	- Catch statement for Exception e is not filled in (possibly an issue with Get Latest Version)
