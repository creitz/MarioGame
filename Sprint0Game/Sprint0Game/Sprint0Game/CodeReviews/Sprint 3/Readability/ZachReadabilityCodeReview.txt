What is readable:
	- The command instantiations are more clearly defined, so as to make their function more explicit
	- The code seems well commented. Clarifies some of the more complex parts of the code.

	

What is not readable: 
	- There is a long string of namespace commands (?) before Keys on a couple occasions which could be
	solved by a using statement. Makes the code a little unreadable.
	- The comment "iterate through pressed..." may be unneeded as the conclusion can be drawn implicitly.
