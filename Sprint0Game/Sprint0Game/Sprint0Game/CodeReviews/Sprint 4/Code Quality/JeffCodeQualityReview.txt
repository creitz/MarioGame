Review:

	Cohesion & Coupling:
		- High cohesion, low coupling. References only MarioActionRequest.

	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		- Cyclomatic complexity isn't too bad. The method with the most branching is RespondToCollisionWithBlockOrPipe()
		  which has 7 possible pathways. This is also the only method with nested 'if' statements.

	Hypothetical Change:
		- Possibly move the logic for Mario bouncing off of enemies/shell to MarioActionRequest, although it would
		  probably be less code in the long run to just keep it here... Up to you.
