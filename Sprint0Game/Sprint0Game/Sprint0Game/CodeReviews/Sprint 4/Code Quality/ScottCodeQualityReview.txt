Code Quality ReviewReviewer: Scott ErvinReview Date: 3/21/2014Sprint: Sprint 4Reviewed File:  Star.csAuthor of file: JeffNumber of Mins to Review: 15Review:      Cohesion & Coupling:-Very high cohesion, low coupling.  Independent of other classes except for needing to know about its sprite, collision detector and the camera.  All of which are needed.	Cyclomatic Complexity:-Low cyclomatic complexity: no if statements used.  One execution path for all methods	Hypothetical Change:-If you wanted to make the star be collected three times before it was deleted.  You would only need to add a counter to the collect method.  Very easy to change any realistic change I can think of.
