Review:

	Cohesion & Coupling:
		- Very high cohesion and low coupling. Not reliant on another major class to function.

	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		-None. There are no loops within the QuestionBlock class.
	
	Hypothetical Change:
		-If, in a later level, you wanted to have blocks that move and aren't just stationary, 
		 modifying this block type would be as simple as adding a property to declare whether the
		 block needs to move or not (boolean) and then adding logic to update CurrentPosition based
	 	 on that boolean flag. The overall code is very compact, simple and does exactly what it needs
		 to and no more making modification for most any block function easy.
