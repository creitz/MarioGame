Review:

	Cohesion & Coupling: High Cohesion, and low coupling. Camera really only needs to know about Mario.
		However, a large amount of methods require knowledge of the camera
		

	Cyclomatic Complexity: Low cyclomatic complexity. The update code block is pretty straightforward
		

	Other Comments: The code is pretty straightforward and easily explainable, however there are few "magic numbers" which could be removed.
		   

	Hypothetical Change

		- You could create some constants in order to clarify the magic numbers in the control for the location
			on the screen when the camera starts to pan back and forth.
