What is readable:

	-Intent of constructor and setDead method is obvious.


What is not readable: 

	-fairly unclear what "count" variable represents.
	-nested ifs is a little tough to read in Update() method.
	-Without having knowledge of the purpose in other sprites, it's unclear why width and height are 
	set to zero if this.Dead, but can probably be inferred.
