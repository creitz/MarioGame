What is readable:

	- Very clear what is happening upon Mario contact with items based on Naming and comments.
	- Overall, spacing is good and naming of methods/variables is very good.

What is not readable: 

	- ShouldTakeDamageFromProjectiles() is a little confusing when trying to break down the
	logic of the layered boolean statement.
	- Several of the collision responding methods contain a decent amount of branching, but
	this is to be expected for the most part in these cases.
