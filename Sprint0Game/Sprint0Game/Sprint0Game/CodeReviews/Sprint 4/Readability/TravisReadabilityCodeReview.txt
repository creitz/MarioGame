What is readable:

	- It's pretty clear what the variables represent, with the exception of alpha which is used for transparency
	  isn't immediately clear in that purpose.
	- The code is sectioned reasonably with comments before large sections of code making it easy to follow some 
	  of the more complex logic.


What is not readable: 

	- Some of the logic in update took a couple of read-throughs to fully understand, especially involving the unit variable.
	- Unclear on what the counter variable is used for until getting to it in the Update() where it can be seen in the logic but
	  never explicitly explained.
