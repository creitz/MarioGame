Review:

	Cohesion & Coupling:
		-Pretty high cohesion.  The only thing that doesn't quite seem like it fits in the class
		is LevelComplete.  At first glance, at least, it seems like that would belong in Level or 
		elsewhere.
		-It is fairly tightly coupled with its collision responder and its sprite, but that's not 
		necessarily a bad thing.  Good organization of tasks.   

	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		-Very low cyclomatic complexity.  Only one path of execution through the constructor and all 
		methods.  

	Other Comments:
		-Without other knowledge about its use in other classes, it's unclear what the purpose
		of HasBeenReached is, and why it's set to true immediately in the constructor.   


	Hypothetical Change:
		-Flag is mostly a container class for, so it seems it would be relatively straightforward to
		implement any change.  For example, the flag's initial velocity could easily be changed by 
		altering the initial value in the constructor.  On the other hand, the dimensions and other 
		similar metrics of the flag are dictated by the sprite, so those items could probably easily
		be added to or modificed, but not directly from within this class.
