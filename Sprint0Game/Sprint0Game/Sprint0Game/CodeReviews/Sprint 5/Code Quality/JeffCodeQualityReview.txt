Review:

	Cohesion & Coupling:
		- High cohesion. Everything in this class contributes to drawing the different features
		  displayed on the screen during gameplay.

		- Knows about Level, SpriteHolder, HUDConfig, and GameStats. All of which are necessary to
		  display the necessary data required of the HUD.

	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		- Low cyclomatic complexity. One path of execution through the constructor and all of the 
		  methods except Draw() which has two.  

	Hypothetical Change:
		- As far as quality goes, this class is very well done and serves a well-defined purpose.
		  The only thing I would add to the class is the function of displaying the number of lives 
		  remaining on the HUD as well. This could be easily implemented without requiring additional
		  coupling with any more classes.
