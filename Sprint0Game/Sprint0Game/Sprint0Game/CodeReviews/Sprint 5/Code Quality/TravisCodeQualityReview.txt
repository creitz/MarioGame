Review:

	Cohesion & Coupling:
		- Very high cohesion and low coupling. Only reliant on a level class which makes sense.

	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		-Large amount of nested conditionals and switch statements, mostly in the CreateObjects method. While this is necessary
		 because it needs to read through several lines of a file to generate the level, I'd suggest making a helper method to 
		 make it easier to read and understand from a client perspective.
		-Large amount of case select logic, which is expected in a case by case level creator.
	
	Hypothetical Change:
		-The format of the class makes it so not only can the files read to create the levels be changed easily, but also it is quite 
		 simple to add a new object for the level to draw because all it would need is a symbol in the file and a single case in the 
		 appropriate helper method to draw.
