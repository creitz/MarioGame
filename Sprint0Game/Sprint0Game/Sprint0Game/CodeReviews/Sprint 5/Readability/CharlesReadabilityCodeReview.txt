What is readable:

	-Intent of constructor is pretty readable/clear as far as what it should be accomplishing.  
	-Draw, RespondToCollision, and RespondToNoCollision are very clear
	-Update method is pretty clear (though maybe it would be more readable to have the code inside the 
		if statement handled by the sprite, probably in a method)


What is not readable: 

	-In constructor, somewhat unclear why HasBeenReached is being set to true. 
	-CurrentPosition's initialization in the constructor is a little difficult to decipher
	-Lots of fields
