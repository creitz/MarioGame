What is readable:

	- Everything in the constructor is clear.
	- Variable naming conventions are very good, structure of this class resembles other similar classes which is great.
	- The branching of the draw method into sub-methods is very helpful and helps to avoid any would-be problems.


What is not readable: 

	- A little over 100 lines of code which may be a little excessive for this class.
