What is readable:

	-Constructor is very clear and consise
	-Update is fairly easy to follow.  All logic is short so it is easy to trace

What is not readable: 

	-A little hard to find the diffence in the if(this.EnteringPipe) else
	-Not sure what is entering pipe. Consider renaming to MarioEnteringPipe
