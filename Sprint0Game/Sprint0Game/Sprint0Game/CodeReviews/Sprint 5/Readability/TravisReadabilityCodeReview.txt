What is readable:

	-The purpose of the class as a holder of sounds for the game is fairly apparent
	-While the code is in large chunks, the consistent formatting and spacing make reading through the list of sound effects very simple.
	-It's very clear what the only method (LoadSounds) does


What is not readable: 

	-Large amount of fields, though necessary, is fairly daunting at first glance.
	-The sheer amount of effects make for a lot of repeated code, making it hard to find a specific line or statement.
