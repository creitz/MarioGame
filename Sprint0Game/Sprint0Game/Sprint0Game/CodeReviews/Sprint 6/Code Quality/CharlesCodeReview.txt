Review:

	Cohesion & Coupling:
		-Very high cohesion.  Each field makes a lot of logical sense.  
		-It is mildly to moderately coupled with Level, and indirectly to Mario, but that's okay because
		it is necessary and has very little code that couples them.   

	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		-Pretty low cyclomatic complexity.  Only one path of execution through the constructor and SpawnItem, 
		and two paths through Update().  CreateSpawnItem has 6 paths of execution, but only because of a 
		switch case, so not a big deal.  

	Other Comments:
		-Seems a little strange that there are two spawn frequencies, and that they're multiplied together
		in the constructor.  Might make more sense to just have one frequency.  


	Hypothetical Change:
		-If a new item were added to powerups, only a new case in the switch would have to be added, so that
		is good.  Simple change.
