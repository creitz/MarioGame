Review:

	Cohesion & Coupling:
		- High cohesion. Has an update method that takes input from the keyboard and performs the proper 
		  command. Also a KeyPressed method that returns whether or not a certain key has been pressed on
		  that iteration of update.

		- Tight Coupling. Knows about Menu, ICommand, and IController which are all absolutely necessary 
		  to execute the function of this class.

	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		- At its worse it has 3 levels of nested loops but there is really no other way to get around 
		  writing it this way. 

	Hypothetical Change:
		- There really is no change that could be made that would dramatically improve code quality or the
		  functionality of this class. This class has a relatively simple task and it performs it very well.
