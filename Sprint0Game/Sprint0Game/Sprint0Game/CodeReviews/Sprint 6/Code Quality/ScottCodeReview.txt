Review:

	Cohesion & Coupling:
		-Very high cohesion.  All logic has to do with flying koopa and that alone.  
		-Low coupling overall.  A little coupling with its collision responder and its sprite but that is to be expected   

	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		-Extremely low cyclomatic complexity.  One or two executable paths in each method.  Nice work here.  

	Other Comments:
		-Don't really need to tell flying koopa to go right of left in constructor.  Really could just do this in update.


	Hypothetical Change:
		-If you would want to make a koopa when hit from a fireball as well this would be a simple change due to the bool
		field you created.  Nice simple code makes this change easy.
