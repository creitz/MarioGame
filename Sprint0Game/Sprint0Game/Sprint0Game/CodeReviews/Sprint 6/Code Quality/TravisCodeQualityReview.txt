Review:

	Cohesion & Coupling:
		-Small amount of coupling with the class being bound to a game object and the window dimesions. 
		 Overall this makes sense and isn't really rectifiable.
		-High cohesion, this class covers nearly all functions relatable to level generation and doesn't have much
	 	 domain outside of that.

	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		-Very low cyclomatic complexity throughout the class except in a few areas where it cannot be avoided, such as DrawLevel
		 (because we are drawing on a grid we need a minimum cyclomatic complexity if 2, which is what is used.
		-Some amount of nested if states and if-else-if chains are used in Update, it looks as thought the first two if statements could be
		 combined and since the logic is fairly complex, making a boolean helper class would help clean up the code.		

	Hypothetical Change:
		-If you wanted to add a new type of placeable to the level creater, it would be pretty simple due to the layout of the
		 class and the implmentation of the buttons and drawing of the placeables. One would need to add sprites and add the 
		 placeable type to the buttons and creatbles that are drawn. The logic for actually creating the level relies on codes 
		 for each type, so adding a new type is just a matter of a few lines of code to the Encoder. Overall, adding new things
		 to place in levels is a simple augmentation.
