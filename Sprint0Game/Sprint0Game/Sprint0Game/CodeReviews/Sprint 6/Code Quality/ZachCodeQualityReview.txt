Review:

	Cohesion & Coupling:
		High Cohesion: as this class could be easily ported to any other menu system and still work properly

		Low Coupling: The class needs to know nothing about the game.
		
	Cyclomatic Complexity: High cyclomatic compelexity, which is expected since the class does a
		lot of raw transformations of data. Given the fact that there are a specific number of letters
		it must handle the complexity will be higher.
		 

	Hypothetical Change:

		It would be possible to set this up more as a utility/static class which can just be invoked to change a keybind.
