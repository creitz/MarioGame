What is readable:

	-Intent of constructor is pretty readable/clear as far as what it should be accomplishing, except
	a frequency is passed to it and then multiplied by PowerupSpawnerConfig.SpawnFrequencyMultiplier.  
	-Update() and SpawnItem() are very clear.  Although SpawnItem() could be reduced to one line of code
	by calling CreateSpawnItem() in .Add(), it is very readable this way.  
	-CreateSpawnItem might be a little more readable if there was a default case instead of assigning spawnItem
	otuside of the switch, then letting none of them be the case.  


What is not readable: 

	-Nothing, pretty good.
