What is readable:

	- Everything in the constructor is very clear.
	- Variable naming conventions are pretty good, structure of this class resembles other keyboard classes which is great.
	- Methods are short and clear regarding their purpose.
	- Commenting is quite helpful in this situation.


What is not readable: 

	- Maybe a little confusing regarding the different purposes of the two dictionaries.
