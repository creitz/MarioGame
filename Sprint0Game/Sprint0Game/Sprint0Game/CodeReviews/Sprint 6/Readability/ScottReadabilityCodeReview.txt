What is readable:

	-All naming is very good.  No question is left in the readers mind as to what a variable may mean.
	
	-Methods are very short and to the point.  Most are two lines or so.

	-Conditional statements are not complex at all.


What is not readable: 

	-Nothing very straightforward code
