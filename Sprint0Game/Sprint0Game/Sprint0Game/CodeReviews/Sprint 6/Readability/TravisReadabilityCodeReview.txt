What is readable:
	-Methods are segmented into very organized and understandle code chunks, making large methods
	 easier to follow.
	-Properties are well named and their uses are very clear.
	-Helper methods are very short and easily understood in their purpose.	
	-Code doesn't carry any bloat and feels just as short as it is needed to be.

What is not readable: 
	-Some variables have simplistic but very limiting names such as MouseState m, or Button b.
	 Some more meaningful names would help with understanding the larger methods in the class.
	-Some commenting on the larger methods would make reading faster and easier.
