What is readable:

	- Code is more readable because the method names provide clarity
	- The variables are well named
	- Comments are provided for extra clarity


What is not readable: 
	-The code is a bit long, but this may not be unavoidable
	-Putting entire method returns on one line decrease readability, but also decrease length.
